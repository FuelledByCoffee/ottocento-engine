## References/Resources
While learning Vulkan and graphics programming, I had to heavily resource to an extensive amount of articles, blog posts, YouTube lectures
and also ask around inside communities to better understand the topics I had to study. I am listing these resources below and hopefully
giving them the deserved credit for helping me through this journey.
